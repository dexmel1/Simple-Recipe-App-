Chicken Enchiladas and Sauce
(8 servings)
Enchilada Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons avocado oil (or olive oil)
* 1 small white onion, peeled and diced
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into small 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles
* sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper
* 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
* 8 large flour tortillas
* 3 cups Mexican-blend shredded cheese
* optional toppings: fresh cilantro, chopped red onions, diced avocado, sour cream, and/or crumbled cotija cheese
Sauce Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour*
* 1/4 cup chili powder*
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* fine sea salt, to taste
 Sauce Directions
* Cook the roux and spices: Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Add in the chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and oregano and cook for 1 more minute, whisking constantly.
* Simmer: Gradually pour in the stock, whisking constantly to combine until no lumps remain.  Continue cooking until the sauce reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low to maintain the simmer (the sauce should continue lightly bubbling) for about 10-15 minutes, uncovered, until the sauce has slightly thickened.
* Season: Give the sauce a taste and season with salt, as needed.  (I typically add 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, but the saltiness of the sauce can vary depending on the brand of stock that you use.)
* Serve: Use immediately in your favorite recipe and enjoy!
Enchilada Directions
* Prep oven and enchilada sauce. Preheat oven to 350°F.  Prepare your enchilada sauce.
* Sauté the filling mixture. In large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add diced chicken and green chiles, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.  Sauté the mixture for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through.  Add in the beans and stir until evenly combined.  Remove pan from heat and set aside.
* Assemble the enchiladas. To assemble the enchiladas, set up an assembly line including: tortillas, enchilada sauce, chicken mixture, and cheese. Lay out a tortilla, and spread two tablespoons of sauce over the surface of the tortilla.  Add a generous spoonful of the chicken mixture in a line down the center of the tortilla, then sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up tortilla and place in a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Assemble the remaining enchiladas.  Then spread any remaining sauce evenly over the top of the enchiladas, followed by any extra cheese.
* Bake. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, until the enchiladas are cooked through and the tortillas are slightly crispy on the outside.  Transfer the baking dish to a wire baking rack.
* Serve. Serve the enchiladas immediately while they’re nice and hot and melty, garnished with lots of fresh toppings. Enjoy!
